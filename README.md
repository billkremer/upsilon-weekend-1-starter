# Salary Input form with Monthly Salary Expenditure Calculation

This repository uses jQuery to populate a webpage with employee data using form entry fields then calculating the monthly salary expenditures by totaling the annual salaries of all entered employees and dividing by twelve (12).

Additional functionality is added by allowing the user to delete employees.  The Monthly Salary Expenditure is then updated.

One problem arises with very long names or titles (greater than 30 characters).  It is important to work with the client to ensure that this will fit their needs.
